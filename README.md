# WiiBrowser Lite
WiiBrowser Lite is a homebrew alternative to the Wii's Internet Channel and an updated version of the original WiiBrowser created by gave92. The main goal is to provide a more modern codebase to make it easier for other developers to work on. Although I am not doing much actual work on it myself, contributions through pull requests and similar methods are still welcome.
